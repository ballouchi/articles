### Les 10 principaux opérateurs de recherche
/* September 26, 2014 */

To search for an ftp website, you use ***inurl:ftp -inurl:(http|https)***. It means you search for a website with
ftp in its URL and the minus (-) removes the results with http/https in the URL so that you receive just
the ftp results.

To search for a specific file type, you use ***filetype:pdf***. To limit the search to a specific word in the title,
you use ***intitle:analysis or intext:analysis***.
Basically, your query needs to look like this:

> inurl:ftp -inurl:(http|https) filetype:pdf intitle:analysis
